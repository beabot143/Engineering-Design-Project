		MCGILL UNIVERSITY CONTACTS
			Pavlos Kollias	-	expert in radar applications in weather and climate research
				puclished a paper on constellation satellites for weather monitoring
					if he's not a dick, might be a key info source
					
			Jean-Pierre Blanchet	-	modelling radiation clouds and aerosol interactions 
				got degree from mcgill, but now a professor at university of Quebec of Montreal
				another key guy
		
	
QuikSCAT (1999 - 2009)
	used radar to monitor widn currents
	total weight: 2000 + 970kg
	propelled craft (hydrazine blowdown)
	ground communication frequency 2-4GHz range		
		2Mbps
	craft power consumption 874W
	13.4 GHz, 110 watt pulse at 189Hz pulse repitition freequency(PRF)
		the higher the PRF, to higher the average power consumption
			we ant low PRF, but high cluster
	1m diameter roating dish for two spot beams
	2000kg
	power 200W40kbps
