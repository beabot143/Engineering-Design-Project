CRYPTO, and how it can relate to space

all crypto is a large list/ledger of a certain type of data (transactions, or contracts between parties, etc)
	hashed with a certain algorithm for sercurity
	anybody who's able to solve the hash gets a coin
	but the value comes from the stored information always being accessible, and the security is that nobody can access it?
	
	if we send crypto beacons up into space, unless we can guarantee a communication link between them, then there's no point.
		crypto only works when you have communication
		
	for ethereum, the algorithm shifts the difficulty of the program to maintain a certain level of difficulty in solving the hash (12-15s)
	
	if there was a way to combine space mapping data and crypto, maybe we could generate some kind of interest in the subject
		the more tokens (picosats) you buy, the higher the resolution of our space map, and the more coins you can generate
			what happens when you generate too many coins and you saturate the entire orbitting space with garbage?
			
	basically the XYO netowrk is saying that theyll put RFID tags on everything, that will be recorded by some IoT device, and then stored as a ledger.
		IDK how difficult this is, but the hard part would be to create theri sentinels
