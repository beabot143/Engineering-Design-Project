so we're supposed to keep brainstorming ideas and determine not only the feasability, but also the commercial interest
	
	debris mapping isn't commercially interesting
	
	refueling was interesting and got funding
		the mechanical labour required for it is too high
		
	maybe something along the lines of cyrpto? idk would have to research how to blockchain something
	
	said monitoring bacterial test slides was kinda interesting
	
	prof was thinking something that satellites could do in the entertainment sector (RC satellites? videogame relations besides space server? idk)
	
gotta keep doing this until next week before we decide what we're gonna make
