5kg satellite is still commercialy viable

camera 		is classic (we want to disrupt)
atmosphere 	is classic

anything dealing with biomedical
	bacterial/life 	analysis
	material 		analysis
	
	some interesting payload that can be miniaturized 
	
	we need to figure out what research can be done at 300km environment
	
	10x10x10cm max
	100g
	
	what things need to be monitored at low pressure and high radiation
	
	space junk
		small massive inductive pulse
		.
		for LEO they suggest using gas explosives
			not easy for us to do: need oxidizer with fuel; must be pressurized; we can't pay for that
			
		one easy metric is this: the higher the power consumption, the higher to weight and cost. BUT, the more work we can do.
		
		catching/pulling it with magnets will be impossible
			what about mapping? most services nowadays use machine learning and neural networks to predict trajectories of orbiting satellites
				this only works if the space debris doesn't increase
					particulate dust and paint flecks are an issue that have yet to be resolved
						this is hazardous to space station and cant be detected by radar
						everything is flying at each other at 10km/s, so explosions happen
						last year recently launched a satellite to monitor and detect space debris
							used two large sheets (one in front of another) and determined the speed
								reason why it was sheets is because alot of debris isn't magnetic, and ultrasonic doesn't work without air
										
						if we can help build a map of the space debris, maybe we can begin to determine betteer mapping (same way they do for large)
						map out large clouds and such, maybe assist in the development of a collection system
						
						systems like this have been done before, but nothing public and light, and a map hasn't been created yet
						
						need to come up of a sensory system for small particulate matter, and a communication system
							maybe a bunch of tiny sensors linked together by physical thin wire tether(acts as communication too)
							
						how about RF communication between a bunch of modules? signal strength can be measured, and depending on the attenuation and duration of attenuation, we can determine the debris speed and direction (if we had mimo array)
