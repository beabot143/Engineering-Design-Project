Synthesis COnditions
type
	125C above
	form at room temperature (3-5)
	
	lower temperature smaller MOF (need to wait longer ~ 10days)
		transparent (seethrough) tendo effect
	
	research into making smaller
		currently as big as 10microns
			surface alignment plays a big issue in this
		
	
	MOF system
	MIL system in EU
	solvent is dmf 
		hydolizes metals, starts to form bonds with ligands
		if stored in dmf, can keep in seperate containers
		
	ultrasound could induce nucleai
		bc bubbles 
		
		
Characertiztion of size nm - um
	size of crystal - SEM not good for nm
	
	need to know material grows at zero 
	
	maximizing surfacce vs. volume.
	
	neutron diffraction needs to knock out the electrons to create diffractions, so high energy
	
	unless they form covalent bonds, 
	
	one way is FTIR to quantify the sample size and raman scattering 
		once we find the unique bench
