Satellite Project

	Based on both the kicksat and Starshot (Prof says its google singularity, but these match the description)
	
	Kicksat Example
		3.5 x 3.5 cm PCB board of total mass ~4grams
		System Overview:____________
			Magnetometer & Gyroscope__________________________________________________________________________ 
				Magnetometer determines direction of earth (assuming it's the strongest magnetic field source)
				Then with the gyroscope, determines orientation relative to the earth (must be able to calculate this)
				
			MCU__________________________________________________________________________________________
				used to calculate satellite orientation to earth, and send that as signal through antenna
			
			Antenna______________________________________________
				Used to send signal through vaccuum and earth atm
				frequency tbd
				
			Solar Cells___________________________________________________________________
				Used as onboard power source (constitues approximately half of the board )
			
		Achievements:_________________________________________________
			First to ever send satellite as light and small into orbit
				
		Still to achieve:_________________________________________________________________________
			cannot be sent alone; needed to be onboard of a "mother satellite" that was way larger
			data was not very useful (more proof of concept than actual product)
				
	Starshot Example
	
		Led by Stephen Hawking (He's dead now, so this is probably close to cancelled)
			satellite meant to be send to explanets
			Planned to use 100GW laser as optical propulsion "fuel supply"
			meant to go to I think the alpha centauri system and then send data
			
WHAT CAN WE DO TO IMPROVE ON THESE DESIGNS?
	well, apparently the profs made one thats 10 grams (or kg I forget).
		as far as specs go, it shouldn't be too hard to replicate the design used by kick sat (fairly standard imo)
			main issue will be design verification, because we can design it for earth but not for space
			best would be if there was some way that we could have an actual module in orbit 
			
	forget all of that. The minimum weight requirement may make our design cheaper, but they neglect to inform you that they can't be sent
	on their own. They need another satelite in order to be deployed. These satelites also can't adjust for position, since any propuslion system 
	will significantly increase our weight cost.
	
	things to consider:
		do we want to just make it even more light and small? (flex PCB, chinese parts, etc.)
		make it into an IC? (maybe free; will definately be time consuming; why even if on market already?)
		
		Add IR laser communication?(Higher data rates than RF; uncharted waters; again would be great if physical demonstration was possible of system)
		
		how do we demonstrate something awesome if all we have is a tiny little board?
			if we can we'll borrow the liquid engine rocket from rpg
			
		Do we want to add propulsion AND make as small as possible?
		
		what is our satellite for? (obviously commercial would be in orbit use)
			faster streaming service? if you can achieve 200Gbs, the skies the limit om data transfer
			so long as IR can be beamed down safe and soundly, no problems
			maybe think more commercial than anything
			
			infrastructure costs would completely vanish if we could cheaply launch a network of satellites up to space
				apparently bullets cause too much stress on component
