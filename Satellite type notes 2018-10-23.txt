CURRENT REQUESTS:

Research how to make android into phone
	not good; power consumption alone requires excessive weight (~150g)
		if 100g satellite allow, possible to create easy alternative to circuit board design using smartphone board
		aveage power consumption ~10W, so assume about 20W power consumption
		quickest solutiion would be to buy android TV box or android phone and see if it will work (still size and power limits)
			but it will technicallty work
			may be able to atach camera module to it.
			
		Big issue is that while we design for -40, it will be colder (space afterall)
			prof says its fine; I say otherwise
			
		
		
		
MY REQUESTS:
	find a small camera and figure out a way to use it in -60C.
	
	A big-ass weather balloon is needed to carry a 250g weight up to 30km
	
	probably need to go for mylar balloons since they have high tensile strength
	
	helium and hydrogen will leak out of the balloon as the pressure decreases outside
		methane may be a good alternative, but will require more gas (not good)
		nitrogen is also possible, but your lift:weight ratio is low (only 3%)
		
	lift force is simply the difference in densities
		
		F_Buoyant = (d_air - d_gas)× Volume_gas × g
				d_air ~= 1.225kg/m3
				
				d = s * t  +  1/2 * a * t^2
				(0.5a)t^2 + (o)t -d = 0
				t = sqrt(2d/a)
